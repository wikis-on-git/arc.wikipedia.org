Hi, the official Syriac name of the monastery is: ܥܘܡܪܐ ܕܡܪܝ ܓܒܪܐܝܠ
I think that's why we should change the title [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 18:13, 15 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)

I'm not entirely convinced that it is. I know I've seen that name above a doorway somewhere, but [http://www.morgabriel.org/ the official site says otherwise]. --[[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] 17:29, 16 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)

Soow, what should we do. Follow the official website anno 2010? or follow the ancient official sign above the doorway? [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 18:27, 16 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)

Michaelovic, I highly doubt that the sign is "ancient" with the Turkish written in Latin script underneath (the Latin script, of course, only having been used to write Turkish starting from 1928). :)

Anyway, there are other monasteries with the name "ܕܝܪܐ", there's a consistency issue. I think it would be too hasty to change it based on a plaque that we know little about. --[[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] 19:39, 16 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)
