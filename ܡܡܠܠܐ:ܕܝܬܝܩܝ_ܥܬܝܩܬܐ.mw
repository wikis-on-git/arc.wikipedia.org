Hey, I know I'm beginning to be very annoying:P. But the thing is that the Bible, Beth gazo and the Testament of Mor Afrem write it like ܕܝܬܝܩܝ. If you want to check it, try this link: [http://www.morephrem.com]. BTW the same Bible writes the hole thing as:  ܕܝܬܝܩܝ ܥܬܝܩܐ [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 13:13, 17 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)
