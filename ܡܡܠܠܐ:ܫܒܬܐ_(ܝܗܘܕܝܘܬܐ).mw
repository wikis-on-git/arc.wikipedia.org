*I have noticed that TFighterPilot has changed ܡܩܪܫܐ to ܩܕܝܫܐ. I personally believe the first one is more correct simply because it's the one used in vernacular dialects, although the second one isn't necessarily "wrong".
*The Peshitta is actually using the word [[ܫܒܬܐ]] for Sabbath.[http://dukhrana.com/peshitta/analyze_verse.php?verse=Mark+2:27&font=Estrangelo+Edessa&size=150%] Do you suggest that we keep the title or move to say [[ܫܒܬ (ܝܗܘܕܝܘܬܐ)]]? --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|Rafy]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 03:02, 23 ܒܐܒ 2011 (UTC)
