*I have noticed that TFighterPilot has changed ܡܩܪܫܐ to ܩܕܝܫܐ. I personally believe the first one is more correct simply because it's the one used in vernacular dialects, although the second one isn't necessarily "wrong".
*The Peshitta is actually using the word [[ܫܒܬܐ]] for Sabbath.[http://dukhrana.com/peshitta/analyze_verse.php?verse=Mark+2:27&font=Estrangelo+Edessa&size=150%] Do you suggest that we keep the title or move to say [[ܫܒܬ (ܝܗܘܕܝܘܬܐ)]]? --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|Rafy]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 03:02, 23 ܒܐܒ 2011 (UTC)

When you say ܡܩܪܫܐ, do you actually mean ܡܩܕܫܐ? Because personally I believe the word ܡܩܪܫܐ (mqrva) doesn't exist. At least, I never heard of it and could not find it in a dictionary. In this case I would choose ܩܕܝܫܐ. But then again..I could be wrong about the word.

When you mean ܡܩܕܫܐ (mqdva) then it's important to know that the choice is depending on what grammatical sentence it is used. They are both nice words, but when we look at the sentence' structure, then it is wise to use ܩܕܝܫܐ. When we look at how the sentence was before Tfighterpilot made some changes, then I would use ܡܩܕܫܐ.

Secondly for the title, I would indeed use a word that older documents already use. Since the Peshitta uses ܫܒܬܐ, I would recommend to move the title to [[ܫܒܬܐ (ܝܗܘܕܝܘܬܐ)]] (not ܫܒܬ (ܝܗܘܕܝܘܬܐ) ). [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 19:49, 24 ܒܐܒ 2011 (UTC)

Actually I just thought it's a typo, I knew the ܪ wasn't right so I changed the whole word. My only source is two online dictionaries, as Aramaic speakers you should know the best. The word ܡܩܕܫܐ doesn't exist in neither of them, what's the difference between it and ܩܕܝܫܐ? [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|TFighterPilot]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 17:20, 25 ܒܐܒ 2011 (UTC)

There is no difference meaning, but in grammatical sence. ܩܕܝܫܐ is a noun. ܡܩܕܫܐ is an adjective. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 17:35, 25 ܒܐܒ 2011 (UTC)
