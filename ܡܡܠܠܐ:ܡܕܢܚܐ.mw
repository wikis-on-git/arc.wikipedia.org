Dear 334a,
If you check the Compendious Syriac Dictionary you will find that both ܡܕܢܚܐ is masculine and nothing about ܡܥܪܒܐ , while Manna dictionary and "Treasure of the Syriac Language" by Thomas Audo state that both ܡܕܢܚܐ and ܡܥܪܒܐ are both masculine and feminine so I preferred to use the masculine form and still think it is better than the feminine form.
----
Theodor Nöldeke's ''Compendious Syriac Grammar'' lists both ܡܕܢܚܐ and ܡܥܪܒܐ as feminine on page 57, as does peshitta.org's lexicon. The only time ܡܕܢܚܐ can be masculine is if it's in the plural construct state (ܡܕ̈ܢܚܝ), which is what the ''Compendious Syriac Dictionary'' actually says and can be confirmed using the [http://www.peshitta.org/lexicon/ lexicon at peshitta.org]: search '''0xndm''' as the lexeme and the only time you'll find it as a masculine is in the construct plural. I've said before about Manna's dictionary having modern loanwords, so I'm not so confident in it. --[[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] 01:41, 26 ܐܝܠܘܠ 2009 (UTC)
