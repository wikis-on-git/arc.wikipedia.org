Dear 334a,
If you check the Compendious Syriac Dictionary you will find that both ܡܕܢܚܐ is masculine and nothing about ܡܥܪܒܐ , while Manna dictionary and "Treasure of the Syriac Language" by Thomas Audo state that both ܡܕܢܚܐ and ܡܥܪܒܐ are both masculine and feminine so I preferred to use the masculine form and still think it is better than the feminine form.
