First, if the spelling is the same (or nearly the same) in both Arabic and Hebrew, then I go with that spelling (this used to be the case for Turkey, but the Hebrew spelling recently changed). Basically, translate:
*t=ܛ
*th=ܬ
*k=ܩ
*kh=ܟ
No matter how else you see it in any modern dictionary. Don't trust modern dictionaries. That's the older method, used in Hebrew but not Arabic (the former being more closely related to our language, especially transliteration-wise). This is the reason "Italy" is spelled [[ܐܝܛܠܝܐ]] instead of "ܐܝܬܠܝܐ," the latter spelling would mean it's pronounced like "I'''th'''alia." --[[User:3345345335534|3345345335534]] 03:15, 9 ܐܕܪ 2008 (UTC)

̈̈I find this pretty much incorrect. Taw doesn't always mean to become "th", in a lot of cases taw becomes t as in "Tawra, Qadishat, Meshtaylonutho(two taws with one taw becoming "th"". I think we should revert all incorrect Q back to K. Peace --[[User:Assyria 90|Assyria 90]] 18:17, 18 ܐܕܪ 2008 (UTC)

Please, just try to understand what I'm saying at least. Don't just keep using the system you're using now. The point isn't to match up the sounds exactly, the point is to transliterate phonetically contrasting sounds from one language so that they aren't confused with sounds that are in complimentary distribution in our language. Like you said, taw can either be "t" and "th" depending on the situation, so it's the same letter in our language, but Greek, for example, has two separate letters for those sounds. It's not really a "th" that's a taw, it's more like an aspirated t=taw, unaspirated t=teth, aspirated k=kaph, unaspirated k=qoph (this transliteration system was used mainly for Ancient Greek for the letters [[Θ]], [[Τ]], [[Χ]], [[Κ]], respectively, then into other languages like Latin), before the changes in pronounciation of the letters in Modern Greek (e.g., Θ was an aspirated t before it became th). The fact is, that's the way they've been doing it for thousands of years (Check the Bible: Augustus=[[ܐܓܘܣܛܘܣ]], not "ܐܓܘܣܬܘܣ", Caesar=[[ܩܣܪ]], not "ܟܣܪ", and so on). You can see this employed in Greek loanwords: ocean=ωκεανός=[[ܐܘܩܝܢܘܣ]], not "ܐܘܟܝܢܘܣ", key=κλείς=[[ܩܠܝܕܐ]], not "ܟܠܝܕܐ". It's just the method for transliterating (see the chart I made at [[ܐܠܦܒܝܬ ܝܘܢܝܐ]]). It's the same method used in Hebrew too. --[[User:3345345335534|3345345335534]] 21:26, 19 ܐܕܪ 2008 (UTC)

== ܛܘܪܟܝܐ ܘ ܛܘܪܩܝܐ ==

<div dir="ltr">
The name of this lemma is spelled incorrect, because it is not written as “Turqiya”. I have read the explanation above, but it is not entirely correct what is written. For example: The word "Turkey" in Arabic is تركيا, with a ك  “kof” and not a ق “qof”. If it would be spelled with a “qof”, the Arabic word would be ترقيا. I have looked the matter of, in an old dictionary. In the Lexicon Syriacum of Hassan Bar Bahlul, the word “Turkey” is spelled like ܛܘܪܟܝܐ with the Arabic translation تركيا. So the only conclusion which can be made is to change ܛܘܪܩܝܐ into ܛܘܪܟܝܐ. [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 20:08, 11 ܚܙܝܪܢ 2010 (UTC)
