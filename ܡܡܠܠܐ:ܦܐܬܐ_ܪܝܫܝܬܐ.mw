== Renaming the Aramaic (arc) Wikipedia to the Syriac (syc) Wikipedia ==
Dear users, Wikipedia has many projects under several languages. These languages are linked to ISO-codes (International Organisation for Standardization). This wikipedia works under the name of ''Aramaic'', and the ISO code of ''arc''. According to ISO, this ''arc'' is the official Aramaic from 700 till 300 BC. Since we all contribute here in ''one'' specific Aramaic dialect thats suits both Western and Eastern Syriac speakers, that is Classical Syriac, we should change the name of the Aramaic Wikipedia to the more proper name '''the Syriac Wikipedia'''. By also changing the name and code (from arc to syc), we  will match the ISO code that is given to this specific Aramaic dialect (syc stands for Classical Syriac). Writing in other Aramaic dialects would mean that new Wikipedias should open under they're ISO code.

So the proposition is: '''The Aramaic wikipedia with ISO code arc should be renamed to the Syriac Wikipedia with ISO code syc.'''

For more information, see [[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a/ܒܝܬ ܐܪܟܐ 1#Name of this Wiki|this talkpage]]. For more information about ISO codes, see [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp this website ].

== Evaluation Michaelovic as administrator ==

Because my adminship was temporarily, the bureaucrats on meta wiki want a evaluation of my work as admin before they renew the term. Based on the work I've done so far as admin, who objects on a renewal of my term? Thank you. [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 20:46, 3 ܟܢܘܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2011 (UTC)

== Michaelovic for permanent admin ==

Dear all, my second admin term has expired. Therefore I would like to apply for permanent admin rights on this wikipedia. Before the stewards grant me this request, I need the community's approval. You can vote below starting from 19th July 2011 till 27th July 2011. Thank you all in advance. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 20:45, 19 ܒܬܡܘܙ 2011 (UTC)

==Question about article requests==
Where do I post article requests?
I think [[:en:Tariq Aziz]] should have an article in Syriac.
Thanks

:Dear Whispertome, you could request articles right here, or at our village pub: [[ܘܝܩܝܦܕܝܐ:ܬܪܥܐ ܕܟܢܫܐ]]. Tariq Aziz is a good one. I'll see if I have the time to translate (a part of) it around this week. Thanks, [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 22:45, 6 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܩܕܡ 2011 (UTC)

==Template:fmbox==
Hi every one i dont know what is wrong with this fmbox template it's now working properly can any one check it out with me and tell me if am missing some thing that i didn't pay attention to it, and in [[ܐܡܪܝܩܐ ܬܝܡܢܝܬܐ]] the details of Infobox Continent it's not showing on the left it's showing on the right. thank [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Man2fly2002|Man2fly2002]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Man2fly2002|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 02:56, 15 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܩܕܡ 2011 (UTC)
: It is because the borders aren't defined on a proper way. If you would like to see how the borders should be defined, please see [[ܩܠܒܐ:ܨܢܕܘܩ ܥܕܬܐ ܡܕܢܚܝܐ]]. 
:Another thing, is to please naming the templates in Syriac and the categories without Syame (the two dots like ܡܕ̈ܢܬܐ).
:If you still have questions, just ask. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 20:41, 16 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܩܕܡ 2011 (UTC)
