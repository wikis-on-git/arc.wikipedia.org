==Complete the renaming==
It clearly says ”Syriac Wikipedia" on the homepage, but what happened to everything else? The ISO code is still arc, not syc as it should be. And all language links still says "ܐܪܡܝܐ" instead of "ܣܘܪܝܝܐ", it’s time to change that too. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Hadoyo|Hadoyo]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Hadoyo|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 21:12, 26 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)
:Dear Hadoyo, sadly but true, we can't change those things without a developer helping us. Last year we reported a bug on bugzilla to rename the Wikipedia. Unfortunately, there seems to be some technical issues in renaming a wikipedia. Developers find it a bit difficult to do so, you could say. The developers *will* apply the changes, we only don't know when that will be. You can find the bug report right [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26725 here].

::It's true that we just have to be patient with the ISO code switch, but we ''have'' changed the interwiki link before. When I first started editing this wiki, the link read something like "ܕܥܒܪܝܸܛ" ("of Hebrew", but spelled incorrectly). We changed it relatively easily a few years ago to read "ܐܪܡܝܐ", but I can't remember how that was done. Also, the link on the [http://www.wikipedia.org/ main wikipedia page] reads "ܐܬܘܪܝܐ" for some reason...not really sure why it's encoded differently from the interwiki link. Also, over at the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias Meta list of Wikipedias], the link reads "ܐܪܡܝܐ" but the language name is "Assyrian Neo-Aramaic". 
::Akhi Michaelovic, you're much better suited to dealing with this sort of thing than I am. Do you think you could look into it? --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 20:37, 28 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)
:::I'll do my best, but strangly enough, I don't see ܐܬܘܪܝܐ written on the main wikipedia page. Could be a "what-you-see-in-different-area" issue. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 18:20, 29 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)

== Hebrew ==

Why does this wiki use the Arab Syrian alphabet and not the Hebrew one? Aramaic is a Jewish language!
----
:# This is the ''Classical Syriac'' Aramaic Wikipedia and thus is written in the Syria'''c''' alphabet. Calling it the "Syria'''n''' alphabet" is dated (by over a century) and calling it the "Arab Syrian alphabet" is just plain wrong. 
:# Aramaic is/was a vastly international language. It was originally spoken by pagans, ''then'' split into different dialects spoken by Jews, Zoroastrians, Christians (the biggest group in terms of number of speakers today), Mandaeans, Muslims, and others. The various dialects can be written in anything from Old Aramaic to Hebrew to Syriac to Mandaic to Arabic to who knows what other scripts. Jews and the Hebrew alphabet do not have (nor have ever had) a monopoly on the language. --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 02:50, 18 ܒܐܝܠܘܠ 2012 (UTC)
I hope someone will translate http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Maaloula
I am sure this is the right wiki for Ma'loula

== Which dialects does this project support? ==

Does this project support the Mandaic dialect? [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Abrahamic Faiths|Abrahamic Faiths]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Abrahamic Faiths|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 21:21, 7 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2015 (UTC)
----
Shlama Abrahamic Faiths, the language code for this wiki (arc) would make it for Offical Aramaic (a.k.a. Imperial Aramaic), though the actual dialect used is Classical Syriac (whose language code is syc; [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T28725 a URL move is apparently underway]). Unfortunately, there is currently no Mandaic Wikipedia. A hypothetical Mandaic Aramaic Wikipedia would be at mid.wikipedia.org for Modern Mandaic and myz.wikipedia.org for Classical Mandaic. --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 07:09, 8 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2015 (UTC)

What font should I use to view Syriac script? [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:IllogicMink|IllogicMink]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:IllogicMink|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 07:13, 22 ܒܐܝܪ 2015 (UTC)

:Hello IllogicMink, the [http://www.bethmardutho.org/index.php/resources/fonts.html Meltho fonts] would be a good place to start. :) --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 14:19, 23 ܒܐܝܪ 2015 (UTC)

== Wrong style ==

Please remove the fonts <code>Verdana, Arial, Helvetica</code> because they are breaking the style and make titles such as<br>ܡܓܠ̈ܐ ܚܘܝܚ̈ܬܐ<br>to appear as square. Therefore the line<br><code>font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif</code><br>should be<br><code>font-family: sans-serif</code><br>or be entirely removed. <small>--[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Mahmudmasri|Mahmudmasri]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Mahmudmasri|ܡܡܠܠܐ]])</small>
