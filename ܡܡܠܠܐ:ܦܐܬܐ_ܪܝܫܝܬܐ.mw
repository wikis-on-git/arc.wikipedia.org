Please add oc (Occitan, more than 56,400 articles) to the list. Thanks in advance. --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Jfblanc|Jfblanc]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Jfblanc|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 13:14, 3 ܒܟܢܘܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2012 (UTC)

==Complete the renaming==
It clearly says ”Syriac Wikipedia" on the homepage, but what happened to everything else? The ISO code is still arc, not syc as it should be. And all language links still says "ܐܪܡܝܐ" instead of "ܣܘܪܝܝܐ", it’s time to change that too. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Hadoyo|Hadoyo]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Hadoyo|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 21:12, 26 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)
:Dear Hadoyo, sadly but true, we can't change those things without a developer helping us. Last year we reported a bug on bugzilla to rename the Wikipedia. Unfortunately, there seems to be some technical issues in renaming a wikipedia. Developers find it a bit difficult to do so, you could say. The developers *will* apply the changes, we only don't know when that will be. You can find the bug report right [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26725 here].

::It's true that we just have to be patient with the ISO code switch, but we ''have'' changed the interwiki link before. When I first started editing this wiki, the link read something like "ܕܥܒܪܝܸܛ" ("of Hebrew", but spelled incorrectly). We changed it relatively easily a few years ago to read "ܐܪܡܝܐ", but I can't remember how that was done. Also, the link on the [http://www.wikipedia.org/ main wikipedia page] reads "ܐܬܘܪܝܐ" for some reason...not really sure why it's encoded differently from the interwiki link. Also, over at the [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias Meta list of Wikipedias], the link reads "ܐܪܡܝܐ" but the language name is "Assyrian Neo-Aramaic". 
::Akhi Michaelovic, you're much better suited to dealing with this sort of thing than I am. Do you think you could look into it? --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 20:37, 28 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)
:::I'll do my best, but strangly enough, I don't see ܐܬܘܪܝܐ written on the main wikipedia page. Could be a "what-you-see-in-different-area" issue. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 18:20, 29 ܒܫܒܛ 2012 (UTC)
