== Renaming the Aramaic (arc) Wikipedia to the Syriac (syc) Wikipedia ==
Dear users, Wikipedia has many projects under several languages. These languages are linked to ISO-codes (International Organisation for Standardization). This wikipedia works under the name of ''Aramaic'', and the ISO code of ''arc''. According to ISO, this ''arc'' is the official Aramaic from 700 till 300 BC. Since we all contribute here in ''one'' specific Aramaic dialect thats suits both Western and Eastern Syriac speakers, that is Classical Syriac, we should change the name of the Aramaic Wikipedia to the more proper name '''the Syriac Wikipedia'''. By also changing the name and code (from arc to syc), we  will match the ISO code that is given to this specific Aramaic dialect (syc stands for Classical Syriac). Writing in other Aramaic dialects would mean that new Wikipedias should open under they're ISO code.

So the proposition is: '''The Aramaic wikipedia with ISO code arc should be renamed to the Syriac Wikipedia with ISO code syc.'''

== Evaluation Michaelovic as administrator ==

Because my adminship was temporarily, the bureaucrats on meta wiki want a evaluation of my work as admin before they renew the term. Based on the work I've done so far as admin, who objects on a renewal of my term? Thank you. [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 20:46, 3 ܟܢܘܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2011 (UTC)
