== Syriac Wikisource ==

Hello. May I suggest that people here open a local "main page" for texts in Syriac at the [[:oldwikisource:|Multilingual Wikisource]] ? Then you can reference the texts from this Wikipedia.

The link to Wikisource at the Main Page here doesn't currently work. [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Dovi|Dovi]] 13:23, 19 ܟܢܘܢ ܒ 2010 (UTC)

== English please ==

Can I request to translate your articles to Wikipedia, or ask that articles in other languages are translated to Wikipedia here  ?  ......  [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:שחר1979|שחר1979]] 12:26, 10 ܐܕܪ 2010 (UTC)

==Vowel Marks==
I think we should add voweling marks to the Aramaic wikipedia as some people aren't good at reading Aramaic. --[[User:Assyrio|Assyrio]] 00:00, 29 ܐܕܪ 2010 (UTC)

:We're starting to add vowel marks for the titles of articles (based solely for pronunciation purposes) at the bottom of the pages. Vowel marks are helpful for learning how to pronounce the words in the beginning, but are somewhat redundant after some practice. Try to improve your reading without vowel marks. I find it easier to comprehend without vowels because your eyes don't have to scan the letter, then look up or down for the vowel, then go back down and left to see the next letter, and repeating the cycle (like a zigzag). You can just read the letters in a straight line, making it faster to read. Anyway, the Hebrew and Arabic Wikipedias don't include vowel marks in the main bodies of text either. Also, there are two sets of vowel marks: eastern and western. Both cannot be used simultaneously, and picking one as the standard would alienate and be unfair to the other. No vowel marks means comprehension for a wider audience. --[[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] 01:22, 29 ܐܕܪ 2010 (UTC)

==shlma 'loukhun==

Sorry for any mistakes, this is my first time doing anything like this on Wikipedia)

Hello everyone

I use Sibboleth virtual keyboard to type in East Syriac Adiabene and have no idea what to do with the oukhun part in shlma 'loukhun

What I thought at first is to put a rukkakha on the bottom of kap to make it a kind of soft kheth the only reason I did this was because in my madnkhayeh Bible there is a dot under the kap when Jeus says "aloukhoun" and I remember reading somewhere that rukkakha can make kap turn to a soft kheth, therefore I assumed that

ܫܠܡܐ ܥܠܘܟ݂ܘܢ

was the right way. However in my madnkhaya text the kap is staying in it's solo form with a dot simply under it when I put the rukkakha on

So to help me clarify this can someone just write shlma 'loukhun in Aramaic text for me and specify to me what they used to make the kap have a kh sound

Thanks!

==Admin approval==
Hi everybody, I want to apply for permanent admin rights. I would be glad if you would all approve my request. Having admin rights would make reverting vandalism much easier. Also with admin rights, I would not be dependent of only one active admin on this Wikipedia. Because I need the communities vote first, feel free to vote. Thank you all.

== Dialect ==

Is there a specific dialect of Aramaic that this wiki is written in?
For example, Syriac or Neo-Aramaic or Mandiac. I'm guessing Syriac or Neo-Aramaic based off the writing on the logo. Once I improve my Aramaic I would like to help out on this wiki someday!

:Dear DZGuymed, This wikipedia is written in classical (literairy) Syriac. We would be very glad if you could help us making this a better wiki when your Syriac is improved :) Greetings, [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 11:51, 5 ܬܫܪܝܢ ܐܚܪܝ 2010 (UTC)


== Renaming the Aramaic (arc) Wikipedia to the Syriac (syc) Wikipedia ==
Dear users, Wikipedia has many projects under several languages. These languages are linked to ISO-codes (International Organisation for Standardization). This wikipedia works under the name of ''Aramaic'', and the ISO code of ''arc''. According to ISO, this ''arc'' is the official Aramaic from 700 till 300 BC. Since we all contribute here in ''one'' specific Aramaic dialect thats suits both Western and Eastern Syriac speakers, that is Classical Syriac, we should change the name of the Aramaic Wikipedia to the more proper name '''the Syriac Wikipedia'''. By also changing the name and code (from arc to syc), we  will match the ISO code that is given to this specific Aramaic dialect (syc stands for Classical Syriac). Writing in other Aramaic dialects would mean that new Wikipedias should open under they're ISO code.

So the proposition is: '''The Aramaic wikipedia with ISO code arc should be renamed to the Syriac Wikipedia with ISO code syc.'''

For more information, see [[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:334a#Name of this Wiki|this talkpage]]. For more information about ISO codes, see [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp this website ].

Voting is possible till January 13th 2011 (that means on the 14th, no more voting). [[ܡܬܚܫܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] 21:52, 23 ܟܢܘܢ ܩܕܡ 2010 (UTC)
