Should it be with an Ayin rather than an Alef? [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|TFighterPilot]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 17:50, 2 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2011 (UTC)

You make a good point, since the language is also written with a ayin. Lets see what 334a thinks about this. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 18:52, 2 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2011 (UTC)

Technically, it should be ܥܪܒ, but that's also the spelling for "Araba", near Nisibis. Saudi Arabia, for example, is also spelled ܥܪܒ ܣܥܘܕܝܬܐ. The current spelling is actually from Greek (evidenced by the lack of Ayin and the presence of the -ia ending). It probably should be moved to ܥܪܒ, but I'm too lazy to make a disambiguation page. :) --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 21:34, 2 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2011 (UTC)
