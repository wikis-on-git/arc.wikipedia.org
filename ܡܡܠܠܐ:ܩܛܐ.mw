Isn't "Shunra" the word for cat? I know this word from the Passover Hagada and I doubt it exists only in Jewish Aramaic since it's quite different than the Hebrew word "Chatul". [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|TFighterPilot]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:TFighterPilot|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 18:17, 6 ܒܬܡܘܙ 2011 (UTC)

'''ܫܢܪܐ''' is a general name given to all felines afaik.[http://dukhrana.com/lexicon/TomaAudo/page.php?p=1074].--[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|Rafy]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 23:42, 6 ܒܬܡܘܙ 2011 (UTC)

"Shunara" (ܫܘܢܪܐ) is definitely a word for "cat." "Qa6a" or "Qa6u" (ܩܛܘ) is actually a borrowed word, but nobody really knows which exact language it came from ([[en:wikt:ܩܛܐ|see here]]). I always hear "Qa6'''u'''" in the modern vernacular languages, I don't think I've ever heard "shunara." --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 00:59, 9 ܒܬܡܘܙ 2011 (UTC)
