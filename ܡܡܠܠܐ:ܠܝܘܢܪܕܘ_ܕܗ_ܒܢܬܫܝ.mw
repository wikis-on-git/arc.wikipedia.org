I don't want to change the title too quickly. But would ܠܝܘܢܐܪܕܘ ܕܐ ܒܢܬܫܝ be a better title? [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 21:39, 19 ܒܐܝܠܘܠ 2011 (UTC)
:I had my doubts as well... I simply took the Hebrew naming. They seem to use ܕܗ for da,di,de,du etc which is "neater" imho... If you find ܕܐ more appropriate for Syriac then wouldn't mind changing it.--[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|Rafy]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 22:05, 19 ܒܐܝܠܘܠ 2011 (UTC)
