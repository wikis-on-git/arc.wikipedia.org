I would recommend using ܩܪܒܐ ܓܘܝܐ for this article, because this term is more common. I'm not sure if ܩܪܒܐ ܪܥܝܬܝܐ exist. At least I can't find any reference to it. [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 13:25, 6 ܒܐܝܠܘܠ 2011 (UTC)

[http://www.premiumwanadoo.com/cuneiform.languages/syriac/dosearch.php?searchkey=13675&language=id ܪܥܝܬ] is used is both citizen and civilian so I coined the term myself so that it closest to "civil war". if you think that ܓܘܝܐ is better then I don't mind moving it.--[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|Rafy]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Rafy|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 14:26, 6 ܒܐܝܠܘܠ 2011 (UTC)
