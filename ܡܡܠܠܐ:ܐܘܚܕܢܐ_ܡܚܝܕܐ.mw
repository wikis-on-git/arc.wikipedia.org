I have been working to change the way the fonts looks like because it's to small and i have been told people are struggling to read them most of the times so i have tried to change the font in two articles wich is [[ܐܘܚܕܢܐ ܡܚܝܕܐ]] and [[ܠܫܢܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ]] so if it's clear with all the internet explorers that you guys have and every one is happy we can try to make look like this but i wish if someone can find a better way and more easy to do it. 

best regards Tawdy [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Man2fly2002|Man2fly2002]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Man2fly2002|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 07:14, 31 ܒܐܝܪ 2012 (UTC)
