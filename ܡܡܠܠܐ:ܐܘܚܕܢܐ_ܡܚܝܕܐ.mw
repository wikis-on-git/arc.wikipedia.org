I have been working to change the way the fonts looks like because it's to small and i have been told people are struggling to read them most of the times so i have tried to change the font in two articles wich is [[ܐܘܚܕܢܐ ܡܚܝܕܐ]] and [[ܠܫܢܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ]] so if it's clear with all the internet explorers that you guys have and every one is happy we can try to make look like this but i wish if someone can find a better way and more easy to do it.

I find that what you're changing the font to looks ''worse'' for me. Please stop that, you're actually going against rule #4 on the [[ܘܝܩܝܦܕܝܐ:ܕܘܒܪܐ|Rules page]]. Try chaning the font settings on your computer. --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 16:01, 4 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2012 (UTC)

I agree with 334a. Also please keep in mind that not all Syriac readers can actually read ''all'' three types of script (Serto, Estrangelo, Madenkhaya). [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 16:13, 4 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2012 (UTC)
