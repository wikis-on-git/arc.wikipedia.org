I have been working to change the way the fonts looks like because it's to small and i have been told people are struggling to read them most of the times so i have tried to change the font in two articles wich is [[ܐܘܚܕܢܐ ܡܚܝܕܐ]] and [[ܠܫܢܐ ܣܘܪܝܝܐ]] so if it's clear with all the internet explorers that you guys have and every one is happy we can try to make look like this but i wish if someone can find a better way and more easy to do it.

I find that what you're changing the font to looks ''worse'' for me. Please stop that, you're actually going against rule #4 on the [[ܘܝܩܝܦܕܝܐ:ܕܘܒܪܐ|Rules page]]. Try chaning the font settings on your computer. --[[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|334a]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:334a|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 16:01, 4 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2012 (UTC)

I agree with 334a. Also please keep in mind that not all Syriac readers can actually read ''all'' three types of script (Serto, Estrangelo, Madenkhaya). [[ܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|Michaelovic]] ([[ܡܡܠܠܐ ܕܡܦܠܚܢܐ:Michaelovic|ܡܡܠܠܐ]]) 16:13, 4 ܒܚܙܝܪܢ 2012 (UTC)

I understand your concerns with the default Syriac font size. I had the same feeling when I started creating articles. I felt that we have to do something about it (see this [http://arc.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%DC%99%DC%98%DC%A5%DC%90_%DC%95%DC%9D%DC%A1%DC%98%DC%A9%DC%AA%DC%9B%DC%9D%DC%90_%DC%90%DC%AC%DC%98%DC%AA%DC%9D%DC%90&diff=next&oldid=24188 example]). It was easy to use the < big> tag, but I realized that this tag makes the article font bigger but uglier, so I stopped using it. Unfortunately, the same applies for the templates that you made.

I think we have to wait until the default Syriac font size is set to a bigger size. Meanwhile, it would be a good idea to make a universal template in all Syriac Wikipedia articles that will make changing the font size (and even switching from Estrangelo to either Eastern or Western fonts) accessable (preferably at the top of the page), By doing this we will make it easier for everybody to be able to see this small font while staying within the limits of #4 rule of this Wikipedia (you will be the guy that could work on that idea should you like it).

Finally, this Wikipedia is for everybody. I guess you dedicated much of your time trying to improve it, as everybody is trying to do here. I hope you will continue supporting this Wikipedia. Just let's try to consult each other when making big changes, as you did earlier, and let's keep those changes within the rules of this Wikipedia.
